## Description

This program iterates over a list of integers and determines whether 
each number is even or odd. It utilizes a bitwise AND operation 
to perform this check efficiently.


## Explanation

- The logic of the code is to determine whether a number is even or odd by using the bitwise AND operation with the value 1. 
  In binary representation, even numbers always have a least significant bit of 0, while odd numbers have a least significant bit of 1. 
  Therefore, when an even number is ANDed with 1, the result is 0 (indicating evenness), and when an odd number is ANDed with 1, the result is 1 (indicating oddness).
